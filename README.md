Parking Lot tracker

The SQL Server Express DB is located in the Database directory in the root of the project.

Vehicle registration and owner usernames are the only required fields when adding/editing

Deleting an owner deletes all associated vehicle records. Deleting a vehicle doesn't
affect the owner other than changing the value for cars owned.
